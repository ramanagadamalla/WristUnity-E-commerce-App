      Plain text is digital text that doesn't have any formatting. It only
      contains standard characters like letters, numbers, and punctuation
      symbols. Plain text doesn't support changing the font, text size, or
      style. It also doesn't allow other elements like tables or embedded
      images. Plain text is a loose term for data that represents only
      characters of readable material. It doesn't include its graphical
      representation or other objects like floating-point numbers or images.
      Plain text is fast and flexible because it doesn't use styles and
      formatting. The file size of plain text format is less than rich text
      format. Plain text files are normally saved as *.txt. Common examples of
      text files include saved email messages, word processing documents, and
      log files. In cryptography, plaintext is usually ordinary readable text
      before it is encrypted into ciphertext, or readable text after it is
      decrypted.
